			<center><h1><small>Frequently Asked Questions</center></h2></small>
                        <center>Here are some frequently asked questions that I receive about CollabVM.
			<center><h2><small>Q1. What is CollabVM?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. CollabVM is a website that lets you control a virtualized Windows 7 machine via your web browser, for fun, testing, and overall entertainment.
			<center><h2><small>Q2. How do I use this website?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. Just click on the screen and wait for your turn. If there are no turns you will be given one automatically.
			<center><h2><small>Q3. The VM is really messed up, slow, or Windows will no longer start, now what?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. If the VM will no longer start or is really messed up, you should click the "Vote for Reset" button to vote for a reset. If it succeeds, this will reset the VM to a clean, non-messed up state. If the VM really needs a manual reset or the vote reset is broken email me at <a href="mailto:rightowner@gmail.com">rightowner@gmail.com</a>.
			<center><h2><small>Q4. Some names are blue or yellow or both, what does that mean?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. A blue name means that person is the one who is currently in control of the virtual machine. Anybody waiting for a turn will receive a yellow name. If they have not requested a turn yet, they won't have any color.
			<center><h2><small>Q5. What happens if the computer is shut down?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. I have made it so turning off the computer is pretty hard. If it is bypassed however nothing happens, it just restarts even if "Shut Down" is clicked.
			<center><h2><small>Q6. What are the specifications of the VM?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. 1.5 gigabytes of RAM, 50 GB hard drive, QEMU64 CPU @ 2 GHz, and a QXL video card capable of supporting 2D graphics.
			<center><h2><small>Q7. Why Windows 7? Why not Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, etc?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. Windows was just the best choice for something like this. In the future however, there will be a wider variation of virtual machines.
			<center><h2><small>Q8. Why won't CollabVM load for me? What's wrong?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. If it doesn't load, please make sure you do not have any of the following addons installed:<br><br>
						<b>NoScript</b><br><br>
						<b>uMatrix</b><br><br>
						<b>Ghostery is also known to affect some users of CollabVM</b><br><br>
						If you have any of these addons installed, make an exception for CollabVM in them and try connecting again.<br><br>
						If you don't have any of those add-ons installed, the servers may be down. Please contact me at rightowner@gmail.com. <br><br>
						An unlikely sceneraio is that you may be banned from CollabVM. To test this, you can use a VPN/proxy to connect. (If you are banned, please do not use a VPN/Proxy to control the virtual machine unless you have my explicit permission. <b>Only do this to check if you are banned.</b>)<br><br>
						If you are banned, please contact me and we can see if we can sort it out.<br>
			<center><h2><small>Q9. What exactly is "off-limits"? Can I be banned? </center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. It is possible to be banned, although it's pretty difficult to do so. Read the <a href="http://computernewb.com/collab-vm/rules">rules</a> if you are concerned about them.
			<center><h2><small>Q10. It's asking me to login to the computer. What is the password?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. By default, there is no password on the computer, not on the Administrator account, nor the default "Dartz" account. If there is one, somebody put it there. If you cannot login just email me at <a href="mailto:rightowner@gmail.com">rightowner@gmail.com</a> and I'll fix it.
			<center><h2><small>Q11. Who coded and designed CollabVM?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. CollabVM was written by Cosmic Sans. The site was designed by Cosmic Sans & Dartz (me).
			<center><h2><small>Q12. It's stuck at a blank screen and on the top left it says "serial console" or "parallel console", help?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. Press CTRL + ALT + 1 to get out of it.
			<center><h2><small>Q13. The keyboard is stuck or is opening shortcuts, help?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. Press CTRL and ALT at the same time on your physical keyboard, this should unstick the keys. If Windows key is held down, press that as well.
			<center><h2><small>Q14. Is it safe to view this at work, school, etc?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. Before you can connect, the computer screen is censored until you click continue, but it's probably best to avoid connecting from an office place, as anyone can do anything, including opening something NSFW (e.g. porn) or even setting it as the wallpaper, for an example.
			<center><h2><small>Q15. Will I break the VM if I go to http://computernewb.com/collab-vm/ on it?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. No, the VM will continue to operate as if nothing is happening, even if you request a turn it will be fine (although the cursor will just stay there during its turn).
			<center><h2><small>Q16. How is this all hosted? </center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. This VM is hosted from a LunaNode KVM VPS server with 4 GB of RAM, using a customly built HTML5 Guacamole.
			<center><h2><small>Q17. Is the project open source?</center></h2></small>
                        <center>A. Unfortunately at this time the project is not open source, but there are plans to release its source code in the future when more time can be made.
